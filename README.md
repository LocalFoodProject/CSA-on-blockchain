## Purpose
Use _solidary contracts_ + _transparent data_ + _good-habit incentivizing_ to __strengthen__ consumer-producer relationships, __shorten__ healthy food supply chains, and __grow__ natural-farming communities organically!

## About me
I have been programming for more than 20 years, had been an academy researcher in Natural Language Processing, lead/developed many web/mobile/game softwares. I retired at the age of 35, went to country-side and learning to be a farmer. Reason: _I sat too much in front of computers and it was not good for my health_.

### Why am I doing this?
The more I know about mordern farming/agriculture, the more I don't belive it won't solve both environment reservation and food secure problems
(watch
[EARTH FROM ABOVE > EPISODE 5: 6 BILLION MEN TO FEED](http://www.yannarthusbertrand.org/en/films-tv/earth-from-above/episode-5-6-milliards-dhommes-a-nourrir) to find out).

The answer is coming-back to tranditional farming methods:
* [natural farming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzs8iFGNdBo)
* [permaculture food forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GJFL0MD9fc)
* [agroforestry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSPNRu4ZPvE)
* and more ...

> Note: I would like to use the term **natural-farming** to mean all of those tranditional farming methods.

The natural-farming communities now are small and need support. I would like to use my programming skill to support me as-a-future-farmer, my farmer fellows in Vietnam and the natural farmming communities in general.

## Code of conducts
[Principles of Teikei](http://urgenci.net/principles-of-teikei) (JAPAN ORGANlC AGRICULTURE ASSOCIATION, NOVEMBER 1978).

Teikei - [the origin](http://urgenci.net/csa-history/) of today worldwide CSA movement - did not say anything about fighting big bad corps but concentrating on the __inner peace & strength__ of the community. It talked about mutual assistance, mutual concession, deepening friendly relationships, self-distribution, democratic management, learning, and steady development.

**_I will not do anything that violate or drift away from those core principles_**

## Why Community Supported Agriculture?
Because it's a solution to secure healthy food sources, shorten food supply-chains and encourage farmers follow natural-farming methods that already be implemented in Japan (since 1973), US (1980s), France (2001) and many other countries.

## What's CSA?
See [localfoodproject.md#whats-csa](./localfoodproject.md#whats-csa)

## Why blockchain?

I belive that blockchain is a greate tool to make CSA solution more completed and effecient that can be applied worldwide. For example, in France comsumers use cheques to release money monthly to producers. In Vietnam, cheques are not in used and we Vietnamese are lacking of financing tools to do the same thing in France. Hence, smart contract can solve it seemlessly and univerally.

The advantage of blockchain can bring to CSA could be:

* Use smart contracts as a source of trust rather than you have to investiage all producers/all consumers

* Use smart contracts to keep everything fair for all stakeholders automatically and exactly as agreed-from-beginning without worrying that people will forget or make mistake will forget to follow the rules (remove third-party coordinators/arbitrators)

* Use smart contracts to incentive good behaviors. For example, I would love to see consumers and producers meeting face-to-face so I wrote the contract to make sure they come to a restaurant together every 3 month, having dinning there and let the contract take care of the payment (e.g require restaurant owner/consumer/producer to co-sign the transaction). Otherwise the contract will use the money preserved for other purpose and consumer-producer have no benefit from it.

We can come up with unlimited, creative solutions to strengthen **solidary** and **incentive good habits**. It's the most fun of writing the smart contracts I guest.

## Blockchain barriers

Farmers don't know how to use metamask, buy ethers ...
It can be solved easily. In Vietnam, old-school farmers use only cash, no bank accounts. So when I want to buy from him remotely, I often ask him that does his son/daughter has bank account? can I send the money to him then you send products to me? Same solution here, we can ask farmer relative to handle metamask/ethers for him, and we have a technical support team to help them do that.

Second barrier is the trust on Ethereum and crytocurrency in general. People trust USD and use USD to estimate the cost, negotiate the prices ... What if after they transfer money to the contract ethers go down, a lot?

What if ethers go down to zero? In this case I think the whole system stop and we are on crisis, since all money gone !!! How should I handle this situation ???

Whatever happen, I would like to implement some scheme of fail safe to make people feel secure enough to use CSA-on-Blockchain.

## Essential metrics
By using transparent data collected by the platform. We could come up with some essential metrics to make sure we are running platform in the right direction.

For example, the platform can measure the distance foods need to travel from farm to table. CSA promoting localization so we expect Avergage Farm-to-Table Distance (AFTD) should be smaller if we run the platform well.

But later, when more and more consumers joined, the AFTD increasing. It's time to look deep in to the data and do customer surveys to find out WHY.

The reason behind should be local consumers have other choices or the (far away) city consumers need the foods the most ...

AFTD is just one example, I would like to find effecient ways to define and estimate below metrics that I assumed they are essential to maintain a healthy CSA. I divided metrics into four categories.

### 1. Consumer-Produce Bonding
#### Consumer-Produce Relationship Quality (CPRQ) Metric
[TODO] Think/find a way to estimate CPRQ
#### Consumer-Produce Risk and Benefit Sharing (CPRB) Metric
[TODO] Think/find a way to estimate CPRB

### 2. Localization
#### Avergage Farm-to-Table Distance (AFTD) Metric
Explained above

[TODO] Think/find more Localization Metrics

### 3. Social Impact
[TODO] Think/find Social Impact Metrics

### 4. Environmental Impact
They can be a combination of total carbon reduction and plus others
[TODO] Think/find Environmental Impact Metrics
#### Total Carbon Reduction (TCR) Metric
[TODO] Think/find a way to estimate TCR

## Implementations
Despite the principles are the same, implementations are vary from country to country or even region to region. The platfrom (csa-on-blockchain) should have multiple implementation schemes, let communities choose the one that suitable for them, and listen to the communities to enhance existing ones / or add more.

_I recommend using a **community-driven development approach** when building the platform._

### The Local Food Project
Our team's Proposal for BSIC - Decentralized Impact Incubator. The original use-case is for India. I hope that the team can evolve it to be used in more countries / regions / use-cases.
