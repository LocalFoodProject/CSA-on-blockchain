## Purpose

Use _solidary contracts_ + _transparent data_ + _good-habit incentivizing_ to __strengthen__ consumer-producer relationships, __shorten__ healthy food supply chains, and __grow__ natural-farming communities organically!

## About me

I have been programming for more than 20 years, had been an academy researcher in Natural Language Processing, lead/developed many web/mobile/game softwares. I retired at the age of 35, went to country-side and learning to be a farmer. Reason: _I sat too much in front of computers and it was not good for my health_.

The more I know about mordern farming/agriculture, the more I don't belive it won't solve both environment reservation and food secure problems
(watch
[EARTH FROM ABOVE > EPISODE 5: 6 BILLION MEN TO FEED](http://www.yannarthusbertrand.org/en/films-tv/earth-from-above/episode-5-6-milliards-dhommes-a-nourrir) to find out).

The answer is coming-back to farming agriculture methods: [natural farming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzs8iFGNdBo) / [permaculture food forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GJFL0MD9fc) / [agroforestry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSPNRu4ZPvE) ...

I would like to use my programming skill to support me as-a-future-farmer, my farmer fellows in Vietnam and the natural farmming communities in general.

## Code of conducts

[Principles of Teikei](http://urgenci.net/principles-of-teikei) (JAPAN ORGANlC AGRICULTURE ASSOCIATION, NOVEMBER 1978).

Teikei - [the origin](http://urgenci.net/csa-history/) of today worldwide CSA movement - did not say anything about fighting big bad corps but concentrating on the __inner peace & strength__ of the community. It talked about mutual assistance, mutual concession, deepening friendly relationships, self-distribution, democratic management, learning, and steady development.

**_I will not do anything that violate or drift away from those core principles_**
